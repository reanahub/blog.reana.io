We are excited to announce the support of user quotas feature which was
introduced in the latest REANA 0.8.0 release. This feature provides more control
over resource allocation for administrators and means to understand resource
availability for the clients. In this blog post, we present a step-by-step
guide on how to set up and use user quotas feature.

In the following example, we shall use the [ROOT6
Roofit](https://github.com/reanahub/reana-demo-root6-roofit/) example
analysis.  We shall create a new workflow and observe user quota changes. Later,
we will explain how to configure user quota feature for administrators.

<!--TODO: add a note that this feature is not enabled in the CERN cluster. -->
