The REANA web interface allows previewing several file types that are present in your workflow workspaces. This may be
very convenient to quickly glance through the produced outputs without having to download them first. The supported file
types for interactive preview include text files, images, PDF files, and ROOT files.

In the "Workspace" tab, it's easy to browse all your workflow files. You can look at details such as the file size and
the last modification date.

## Previewing text files

Probably amongst the most common file types in a workflow workspace are text files. 
These do not only include `.txt` files, but also logs, code, configuration files.
You can preview them (and many other files) just by clicking on the corresponding row; a modal window will open
showing you the file content if the file is supported.

## Previewing images

Images, often produced by plotting libraries, can also be previewed directly in the web UI. 
Note that from the preview window, you can also download the file if you need to.

## HTML files preview

The previewing of HTML files can be valuable especially for Snakemake users. The Snakemake workflow execution creates a
detailed report in the HTML format. You can search your workspace for "report.html" and preview it in a new browser tab:

## PDF files preview

When you click on a PDF file in your workflow's workspace in the web UI
you will be able to scroll through pages, zoom in and out directly from the embedded viewer.
You can use it to quickly inspect the content of any PDF generated by your analysis or uploaded to your
workspace.
Here is a sneak peek of how it looks:

## ROOT files preview

[ROOT](https://root.cern.ch) files can also be previewed directly in the web UI.
The ROOT file viewer is based on [JSROOT](https://root.cern/js/), enabling you to inspect your
ROOT files without leaving your browser.
You can navigate through the file structure, interact with charts and ROOT objects, zoom on some details,
and download the file if needed.
Here you can see the ROOT file viewer in action:

We hope that the interactive file preview feature is proving to be beneficial in your usage of the REANA web interface.
We are striving to continually improve the usability of the system based on your feedback and suggestions. Please let us
know if you would like to support previewing more file types!
